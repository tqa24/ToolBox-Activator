## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

| Issue | Potential Solution |
| --- | --- |
| **"No IDEs Found"** | Run the IDE at least once so it generates its local config folders. |
| **Permission Denied** | On Linux/macOS, use `sudo`. On Windows, run PowerShell as Admin. |
| **Key is Invalid** | Ensure the IDE was **fully closed** during the script execution. |
